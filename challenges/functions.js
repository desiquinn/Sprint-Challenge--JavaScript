// ==== Callbacks ====  

/* Step 1: Create a higher-order function that accepts a callback
  * Create a higher-order function named consume that can take 3 parameters.
  * The first two parameters can accept any argument
  * The last parameter accepts a callback 
  * In the body of the function return the callback with the two parameters that you created
*/

function consume (para1, para2, cb) {
  console.log(cb(para1, para2));
};


/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
  * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
  * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers 
  * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
*/

function add (num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
};

function multiply (num1, num2) {
  return num1 * num2;
};

function greeting (first_name, last_name) {
  return `Hello ${first_name} ${last_name}, nice to meet you!`;
}

/* Step 3: Check your work by un-commenting the following calls to consume(): */
consume(2,2,add); // 4
consume(10,16,multiply); // 160
consume("Mary","Poppins", greeting); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!


// ==== Closures ==== 

// Explain in your own words why `nestedfunction()` can access the variable `internal`.


// Explanation: Functions are closures that are able to search outwardly from their scope for variables that are declared outside their scope to use within their own scope. Since the nested function is within the scope of "myFunction" it can reach the internal variable as well.


const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
